# Regional Sales Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)

## Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on regional sales data. The goal is to analyze sales trends, identify high-performing regions and products, and surface actionable insights through visualizations and summary statistics.

## Project Highlights
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook that walks through the complete EDA process
- Data cleaning and validation steps
- Visualizations to spot trends, seasonality, and performance by region/product
- Exported charts and summary tables for quick reporting

## Repository Structure
- `EDA_Regional_Sales_Analysis.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook with EDA, charts, and insights
- `Sales_data(EDA Exported).csv` — Dataset used for analysis
- `Background/` — Supporting documentation and any additional data or analysis notes
- `README.md` — This file

## Project Status 

- Status: Active — exploratory analyses are complete and additional visualizations and features may be added.
- Notebook last reviewed: 2025-12-02

## Reproducibility & Exports 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook. To reproduce the analyses and export the final report/visualizations programmatically, follow the steps below.

1. Make sure you have a Python environment and required packages installed (see Quick Start).
2. Re-run the notebook and, if you'd like, export it to HTML or PDF:

```pwsh
jupyter nbconvert --to html EDA_Regional_Sales_Analysis.ipynb --output report.html
```

Or convert to PDF (system requirements depend on the PDF generator tool like pandoc or wkhtmltopdf):

```pwsh
jupyter nbconvert --to pdf EDA_Regional_Sales_Analysis.ipynb --output report.pdf
```

## Suggested Requirements

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, create one from your current environment for reproducibility:

```pwsh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Add the usual packages used in the notebook, for example:

```text
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
jupyter
```

## Live Dashboard 🚀

The interactive dashboard for the sales analysis is hosted and available here:

[Live Dashboard (SharePoint)](https://iimv1-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/krishnamurthi_ramesh25-07_iimv_ac_in/IQA8DeIgmvIpQ44KwTziNdHgAQu-Y_0oNwqCtA7gtEj6RgQ?e=GzJBHy)

This link points to the live SharePoint-hosted dashboard. If you'd like the dashboard embedded or hosted elsewhere (e.g., GitHub Pages, Streamlit/Heroku container), I can help set that up.

## CI / Deployment

This repository now includes a GitHub Actions workflow that converts the main notebook to HTML and publishes it to GitHub Pages on each push to `main`.

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/export-and-deploy-notebook.yml`
- Output (GitHub Pages): https://krishnamurthi-ramesh.github.io/Sales-Analysis-Data-Analysis/ (may need enabling for the repository)

After the action runs, a static HTML copy of the notebook will be available at the Pages URL above (or under the owner repo Pages URL).

If you'd like the site to be enabled earlier, open the repo Settings -> Pages and ensure the Pages is configured to use the "GitHub Pages" action or the repository files as the source.


## Dataset
The dataset used for analysis is `Sales_data(EDA Exported).csv`. It contains historical sales records, including columns for region, product, sales volume, unit price, date, and any other features discovered during initial cleaning.

## Quick Start (Windows / PowerShell)
1. (Optional but recommended) Create a Python virtual environment:

```pwsh
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install required packages (example):

```pwsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install the basic packages:

```pwsh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter
```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook / Lab and open the notebook:

```pwsh
jupyter notebook EDA_Regional_Sales_Analysis.ipynb
# or
jupyter lab
```

## What you'll find in the Notebook
- Data loading and initial exploration
- Data cleaning and type conversions
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, counts, etc.)
- Visualizations:
	- Sales over time
	- Regional performance
	- Top-selling products
	- Monthly/quarterly trends
- Key takeaways and suggested next steps

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Simple ways to help:
1. Add a new visualization or analysis in the notebook
2. Propose data cleaning or pipeline improvements
3. Create an issue or pull request with suggested changes or bug fixes
4. Add `requirements.txt` or a `environment.yml` for reproducibility

Please follow these steps to contribute:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make your changes and run the notebook to ensure outputs run correctly
4. Commit your changes and open a Pull Request
