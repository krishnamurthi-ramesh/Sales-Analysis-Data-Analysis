# Contributing to Sales-Analysis-Data-Analysis

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Whether you want to add visualizations, fix a typo, improve reproducibility, or suggest new analyses, your contributions are welcome.

Please follow the steps and guidelines below so contributions stay easy to review and maintain.

## Getting started
- Fork the repository and create a new branch using a descriptive name: `git checkout -b feature/add-plot`.
- Make small, focused changes and test them locally.
- Update `requirements.txt` if you add new Python dependencies.
- Do not commit large datasets, PBIX, or other heavy binary files — if required, provide sample or synthetic data.

## Coding style & Notebook changes
- Keep notebook outputs and large inline images cleared where appropriate, and run the notebook before committing.
- Prefer breaking complex analysis into smaller cells and adding comments for clarity.
- For Python scripts or helper modules, follow PEP8 style and add docstrings.

## Committing
- Use clear, concise, and conventional commit messages (e.g., `feat: add product revenue plot`, `fix: correct date parsing`).
- Keep PRs focused and descriptive. Update the PR description with the goal, the approach, and any review notes.

## Pull Requests
- Open a PR against `main` and link to any relevant issues.
- Add screenshots / sample outputs if you add visualizations or UI changes.
- The repository maintainer (`krishnamurthi-ramesh`) will review and approve PRs.

## Issues
- When opening an issue, include steps to reproduce, expectation vs actual behavior, environment details, and attach small sample data if necessary.

## Data & Licensing
- Do not add raw or sensitive data to the repository. If necessary, store data externally and provide access instructions in the README.
- By contributing to this repository, you agree to license your contributions under the MIT License (see `LICENSE`).

## Contact
- For questions or help, open an issue or reach out to the repo owner through GitHub.

Thanks again — we look forward to your contributions! 🎉
